# Weightless Neural Network study case
This repository is an implementation of the WiSARD â€“ (Wilkes,Stonham, Aleksander Recognition Device) Weghtless Neural Network (WNN) in python using  [the the mnist database of handwritten digits][mninst] as training and testing set.

## Execution:
    - Python 2.7 only.

With training set of 1000 images and test set of  100 the result was 77% right and 23% wrong
With training set of 5000 images and test set of  1000 the result was 553 right and 447 wrong considering points bigger then 0 as filled.
With training set of 5000 images and test set of  1000 the result was 566 right and 434 wrong considering points bigger then 0 as filled.
